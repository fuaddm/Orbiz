## 🧬 Atomic Design Architecture

This project follows the **Atomic Design** methodology for organizing UI components:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, icons.
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms forming functional units, like input fields with labels and buttons.
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections composed of molecules and atoms, such as forms or navbars.

This structure promotes reusability, scalability, and clean separation of concerns in UI development.
